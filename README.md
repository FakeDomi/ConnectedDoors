# Connected Doors

**Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).** This mod makes double doors open and close together when right-clicking or redstone powering either of the sides.

It's recommended, but not required to install the mod both server and client side.

***If installed only on the server:***  
Everything will work, but right-clicking a double door won't open both sides in perfect sync.

***If installed only on the client:***  
You can open double doors by hand. This is done by telling the server you right-clicked both doors, so it might not work on servers with anti-cheat mods / plugins.
